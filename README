jab_simul is a simple Jabber clients load simulator.

To compile it, you probably need to install those packages:
  byacc flex

This tool uses XEP-0078: Non-SASL Authentication, which is obosolete and newer
Jabber/XMPP servers do not support it, or require specific configuration.
For example, in ejabberd, you must enable mod_legacy_auth.

It throws errors when enabling this option in the send_message event:
  <prepend_with_debug_info/>

It supports the old Jabber SSL encryption, but instead of port 5223, it expects it in 5222.
For example, in ejabberd, configure like this:
listen:
  -
    port: 5222
    module: ejabberd_c2s
    tls: true
